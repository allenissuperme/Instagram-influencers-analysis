# Influencer Marketing Campaign for Toy Subscription Box

## Overview

As a marketing analyst at a toy box subscription company, you are starting an influencer marketing campaign, and your team wants to know which influencers you are potentially working with will have the most chance to get the highest return on investment. 

## Step 1: Collecting Influencer Data

First, collect the data from **FeedSpot**, which is a paid service provider that provides statistics for influencers across platforms in a CSV file.

### Scraping Instagram Influencers with Python

We can build a Python script to scrape Instagram influencers.

```python
import instaloader
import pandas as pd

# Initialize Instaloader
L = instaloader.Instaloader()

# Define hashtags related to maternity and baby products
hashtags = ["momlife", "babyproducts", "maternityfashion"]

influencers_data = []

for tag in hashtags:
    posts = instaloader.Hashtag.from_name(L.context, tag).get_posts()
    
    for post in posts:
        username = post.owner_username
        followers = post.owner_profile.followers
        engagement = post.likes / followers if followers > 0 else 0

        if 10000 <= followers <= 100000:  # Micro-influencers range
            influencers_data.append([username, followers, engagement])

        if len(influencers_data) >= 100:  # Limit results
            break

# Save to CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(influencers_data, columns=["Username", "Followers", "Engagement"])
df.to_csv("micro_influencers.csv", index=False)

print("CSV file saved successfully!")
```

## Step 2: Analyzing the Data

The dataset includes key details such as:

- **Influencer Name**
- **Username**
- **Location**
- **Followers**
- **Engagement Rate**
- **Niche**
- **Average Likes**
- **Average Comments**

### Engagement Rate Calculation

The Engagement Rate (ER) is a key metric used in influencer marketing to measure how actively an audience interacts with an influencerâ€™s content.

#### Formula for Engagement Rate:

\[
\text{Engagement Rate (\%)} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Engagements}}{\text{Total Followers}}\right) \times 100
\]

Where:

- **Total Engagements** = Likes + Comments  
- **Total Followers** = Number of followers the influencer has

## Step 3: Filtering Influencers Using SQL

Considering the market and the product, we use SQL to perform the following:

1. **Filter influencers based on West Coast states**
2. **Filter for micro-influencers (10K - 100K followers)**
3. **Rank by Engagement Rate to prioritize highly engaged influencers**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM influencers
WHERE Location IN ('California', 'Oregon', 'Washington', 'Nevada')
  AND Followers BETWEEN 10000 AND 100000
ORDER BY Engagement_Rate DESC;
```

# Step 4: Engagement-to-Follower Ratio (Authenticity Check)

Instead of just using the engagement rate, we calculate the **Engagement-to-Follower Ratio** to identify influencers with a truly engaged audience.

#### Formula:
\[
\text{Engagement Ratio} = \frac{\text{Avg Likes} + \text{Avg Comments}}{\text{Followers}}
\]

```sql
SELECT *, 
       (Avg_Likes + Avg_Comments) / Followers AS Engagement_Ratio
FROM influencers
WHERE Location IN ('California', 'Oregon', 'Washington', 'Nevada')
  AND Followers BETWEEN 10000 AND 100000
ORDER BY Engagement_Ratio DESC;
```
